# Understanding the Vulnerability of CLIP to Image Compression [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14029)

## Abstract
CLIP is a widely used foundational vision-language model that is used for zero-shot image recognition and other
image-text alignment tasks. We demonstrate that CLIP is vulnerable to change in image quality under compression. 
This surprising result is further analysed using an attribution method-Integrated Gradients. 
Using this attribution method, we are able to better understand both quantitatively and qualitatively exactly the 
nature in which the compression affects the zero-shot recognition accuracy of this model. 
We evaluate this extensively on CIFAR-10 and STL-10. Our work provides the basis to understand this vulnerability of 
CLIP and can help us develop more effective methods to improve the robustness of CLIP and other vision-language models.
